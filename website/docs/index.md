Relay.swift brings the power of building GraphQL applications with [Relay](https://relay.dev/en/) to native Swift apps.

Relay.swift is an unofficial port of the official Relay JavaScript framework. Where possible, the APIs try to be very close to the JavaScript equivalent, while still feeling natural to use from Swift.
